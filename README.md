## General programming books

- **The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master** by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas (https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)<br>
Great book, served to me as a very nice summary of all things we should keep in mind as programmers. I can see myself reading some chapters again from time to time.

-  **Working Effectively with Legacy Code** by Michael Feathers (https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)<br>
Interesting book to pickup when dealing with some legacy code. The whole point of this book is to show you various ways how to get code under tests, so you can refactor it safely. Dropped it after a half or so, I see it more as a handbook to pickup when dealing with some similar problem.

- [reading] **Site Reliability Engineering - Google** by Google (https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/)

## Functional programming

- **Category theory for programmers** by Bartosz Milewski (https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf) <br>
Excellent book that gets you into CT pretty quickly. If this would be your first shot with CT, then you will
certainly find helpful Bartosz's talks on youtube, which are great way to deepen the gained knowledge. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LbkfSSR58)

- **Functional Programming in Scala** by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason (https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)<br>
Amazing book ! I couldn't imagine better introduction to FP. It is not about Scala at all, but about core principles of functional programming. Highly recommended. This book tought me about what functional programming is, what are the
basic constructs and then the more advance and abstract ones like monoids, monads, applicative functors etc.

- **FSharp for fun and profit** by Scott Wlaschin (https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/books/)<br>
Big kudos to Scott, he has given us so much material to learn FP and F# from. This is just a must read for someone new to FP or F#. I learned so much from him such as proper domain modeling, composition and many other.

## .NET

- [reading] **Concurrency in .NET** by Riccardo Terrell (https://www.manning.com/books/concurrency-in-dot-net)

- **Pro ASP.NET Core MVC** by Freeman Adam (https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484203972)<br>
Fine book, served me as a better documentation. It is very specific though and I didn't find the examples very good in terms of general programming principles, but sufficient for this specific enviroment.

## Databases

- **Big Data a NoSQL Databáze** (In czech) mainly by Doc. RNDr. Irena Holubová, Ph.D and Ing. Jiří Kosek (http://www.ksi.mff.cuni.cz/bigdata/)<br>
Great book that has widen my knowledge of NoSql. Contrary to other books, this one goes more deeply into the principles like distributed transactions, replication or graph indexing.

## Recommendation systems

- **Recommender Systems Handbook** by Ricci, F., Rokach, L., Shapira, B., Kantor (https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387858203)<br>
Very exhaustive book with almost thousand pages. I read mainly first few chapters introducing the topic in general and it did a good job.

## PHP

- **Domain-Driven Design in PHP** by Carlos Buenosvinos, Christian Soronellas, and Keyvan Akbary (https://leanpub.com/ddd-in-php)<br>
Nice intro to DDD with PHP examples. Didn't read to the end, but found it good.

- **Build APIs You Won't Hate** by Phil Sturgeon (https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate)<br>
Very good introduction to building REST APIS, it teaches you how really should REST API look like and also why.
Shows how to make use of HTTP verbs, resources and HATEOS.

- **PHP the right way** by Josh Lockhart (http://www.phptherightway.com/)<br>
Good read for someone starting in PHP !

## Papers

- **What we talk about when we talk about monads** by Tomas Petricek (http://programming-journal.org/2018/2/12/)
One of the best "tutorials on monads". Very well put.

- **Why most unit testing is waste** by James O Coplien (https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf)
Pretty good summary of advices when unit testing is not required and how to detect tests you can safely remove.
